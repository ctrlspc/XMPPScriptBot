XMPPScriptBot
=============

Created by Jason Marshall ctrlspc@gmail.com

This is a utility that I wrote for the School of Psychology, at the University of Kent (UK). It was designed to allow
a PhD student who was researching cyber-bullying to present a scenario where a test-subject was monitoring what they
thought was a real-time conversation between three people. As the conversation progresses two of the chat-participants begin
to bully the third chat-participant. The test-subject then has the opportunity to intervene in various ways.

This library allows the test conversation to be scripted and 'acted' by XMPP chatbots, allowing the experiment to be
controlled in a way that would be impossible if the conversation was being carried out by real people.

That said it could be used for other things, such as dramatising your favourite passage from a book (as in the example).

This library is MIT licensed so feel free to use it for whatever you like!
This project was made possible largely due to the existence of OpenFire (http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/)
and the SleekXMPP library developed by Nathan Fritz https://github.com/fritzy/SleekXMPP

Development TODO's:
----------------------

1. Proper Sphinx docs
2. Unit tests
