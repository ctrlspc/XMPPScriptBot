This was developed for a Psychology experiment involving user intervention to 
cyber-bullying, carried out in the School of Psychology at the University of Kent.

This project was made possible largely due to the existence of OpenFire (http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/)
and the SleekXMPP library developed by Nathan Fritz https://github.com/fritzy/SleekXMPP

Development TODO's:
----------------------

1. Proper Sphinx docs
2. Unit tests
